# Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship

This project was completed as part of the **Deloitte Forage Data Analytics Virtual Internship**, where I analyzed real-world business problems using Excel and Tableau.



## Project Overview

The internship was split into multiple tasks that tested my ability to clean data, build dashboards, and extract insights from business data.


## Tasks

### Task 1: Assembly Line Issue

**Goal:** Identify which factory had the highest machine breakdowns and the machine types responsible.

**What I did:**
- Cleaned and explored telemetry data from four factories
- Created a calculated field in Tableau to track machine downtime
- Built an interactive dashboard showing total downtime by factory and device type

**What I did:**
- Analyzed equality scores for various job roles across factories
- Classified scores into "Fair", "Unfair", and "Highly Discriminative"
